      <p>
        Yes. You may have multiple languages in the same repository. Blend Python with Javascript or Go with C.

      <h4 class="ui header">Is it safe to use the Codecov Bash uploader?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes. You trust install packages via <var>pip</var>, <var>gem</var>, <var>npm</var> and <var>brew</var>.
        Running Codecov Bash is essentially the same concept. It all comes down to trusting the source of the package.

      <h4 class="ui header">How does Codecov <u>combine matrix builds</u> and multiple CI providers?</h4>
      <p>
        Effortlessly. Codecov merges builds into a single report while maintaining the original source of the coverage data.
        Send as many uploads from different CI providers and languages to Codecov. Plug-and-Play!
        See a fine example here <a href="https://codecov.io/gh/pyca/cryptography">pyca/cryptography</a>.

      <h4 class="ui header">Does Codecov replace my CI provider?</h4>
      <p>
        No, Codecov does not run your test suite. That's the job of a CI provider.
        Codecov does static anaylsis on your repository once your tests are complete and
        coverage reports are uploaded.
