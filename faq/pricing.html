      <h4 class="ui header">Can I trial Codecov before subscribing to a plan?</h4>
      <p>
        No, but we have a good reason. Every account starts with a <b>free</b> private repository credit.
        You can use this credit to test Codecov on one of your private repository.
        However, if your keen on a trial or have questions about pricing please contact <a href="mailto:support@codecov.io">support@codecov.io</a>.

      <h4 class="ui header">How does Codecov interact with my source code?</h4>
      <p>
        <i>Codecov never stores or archives source code.</i>
        There are two distinct moments Codecov will retrieve source code from your repository: upon user request and for static analysis.

      <h4 class="ui header">Does Codecov replace my CI provider?</h4>
      <p>
        No, Codecov does not "test" your code, thats the job of the CI provider.
        Codecov does static anaylsis on your repository once your tests are complete and
        coverage reports are uploaded.

    <div class="ui basic segment">
      <h4 class="ui header">How does Codecov combine matrix builds and multiple CI providers?</h4>
      <p>
        Flawlessly. Codecov merges builds in to a single report while maintaining the original source of the coverage data.
        Send as many uploads from differnt CI providers and languages to Codecov, plug-and-play!
        See a fine example here <a href="https://codecov.io/gh/pyca/cryptography">pyca/cryptography</a>.
