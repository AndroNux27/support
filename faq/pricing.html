      <h4 class="ui header">Does Codecov support multiple languages in a single repository?</h4>
      <p>
        Like a pro! We combine the uploads from multiple languages into a single report while maintaining the original data for each specific language.

      <h4 class="ui header">How does Codecov interact with my source code?</h4>
      <p>
        Codecov does not store source code.
        Codecov will only retrieve source code from your repository for two functions: upon user request and for static analysis.

      <h4 class="ui header">Does Codecov replace my CI provider?</h4>
      <p>
        No, Codecov does not "test" your code, that's the job of the CI provider.
        Codecov does static anaylsis on your repository once your tests are complete and
        coverage reports are uploaded.

      <h4 class="ui header">How does Codecov combine matrix builds and multiple CI providers?</h4>
      <p>
        Effortlessly. Codecov merges builds into a single report while maintaining the original source of the coverage data.
        Send as many uploads from different CI providers and languages to Codecov. Plug-and-Play!
